I'm new to bitcoin and I'm here to fix it!

There are two types of people, those that know what they don't know and those that don't know what they don't know.

When I joined the bitcoin community, I was in the latter camp, and now I'm in the former camp.

So I've recently (past few months) became a bitcoin ossifcationist, 
because I don't think we should be making changes to the main chain without deep consideration of problems that can arise from making a small change.

Right now spam is a problem on bitcoin and it doesn't seem to be getting much attenion. This spam could have been avoided by more careful upgrades.

ALL future upgrades should probably be done on the 2nd layer, and let the main chain stay the way it is, except for critical bugs etc.

This is because bitcoin is not like regular software where we can roll back changes.

Upgrades that we make, will last forever. Imagine 1000 years from now the consequences of making a change that shouldn't have been done.

It will become more and more difficult the bigger it gets to do any kind of roll back.

The size of the database needs to be as small as possible to make sure as many full nodes exist as possible.

Bitcoin only needs to do one thing, and it needs to do it well.

It needs to be a secure way to store value, and nothing else. Keep the fancy upgrades to layer 2.

My 0.02.

I'm with Mechanic on all this stuff, lets make Bitcoin money again, not a place to store jpgs.
Hopefully more poeple will realize this and make the switch to knots.

Best comment under the video:

Why is the one dude covering his face? 
Answer: He's is protecting his identity by using a physical filter. lol :D

Btw, I need to make a distiction, when I was saying in my original post I was an ossifcationist except for crital bugs etc, I was talking about the bitcoin protocol, not the client side software which obviously needs updates!

As far as protocol stuff, perhaps there's a need for CTV but other than crital bugs after that I'm not seeing anything that's needed. I'm still not fully sold on CTV but if Mechanic is backing it I tend to side with him.
